### Info
LWJBCC is a Lightweight Java Batch Code Compiler and acts as a batchfile frontend to javac and jar to make .jars

here's a demo of it

![LWJBCCDemo](https://github.com/Vincent392/LWJBCC/assets/90470156/7535ad14-b49e-4083-92db-9273e52b9a47)

yes, I use Windows 8.1 btw

it should also work for JFX (JavaFX) but I haven't tested it yet.

Also considering .bat files are just two clicks and you can view the source code I've put this under GPLV3
all I do ask though is to credit me.

also heres the [jar](https://github.com/Vincent392/LWJBCC/releases/download/Jardemo/LWJBCC-Demo.jar) that was made
